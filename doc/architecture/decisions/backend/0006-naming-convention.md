# 6. Backend file naming convention

Date: 2021-03-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We were using different file naming conventions.

## Decision

We will name the files in `kebab-case`. After a dot we add the type of the file, like `controller` or `service`.

## Consequences

The file names are consistent.
We still may have some pieces of code not following the decision. Please use the boy-scout rule and apply the decision to any file you touch.
