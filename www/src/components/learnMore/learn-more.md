## How to add a proposal using BrightTreasury

BrightTreasury's aim is to make the application for Treasury funds a smooth and intuitive process. It's simple - first you create an Idea for your Proposal to discuss it and check with the community - then when you're ready you turn it into a formal proposal and in the end - you see the voting results and get the decision!

Let's go through the process step by step:

### 1\. Share an Idea

The first step  of course is to have an idea for an activity that might contribute to the Polkadot or Kusama networks community. Maybe one that would benefit both? If you have something in mind, then go on, show others what you came up with.

a. Go to [Sign-up page](https://treasury.bright.dev/auth/signup/email?networkId=polkadot) and create an account. You can sign up using your email address or your Web3 blockchain account (with [polkadot extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)) if you already have one. If you don't, no worries, you can always add it later to your email based account in the settings page.

b. Second step is to present your idea to the network's community. Just click the "+Introduce Idea" button and try to give as many details about your idea as possible.

It might be good to divide your planned activities into milestones, so it's clear what is the schedule that you foresee. Need more time to work on the description? Save your idea as a draft and publish it whenever you feel ready.

c. Once it's published, it will be visible to the network's community and discussion can begin. You will be notified whenever a new comment appears, so you can answer any questions that the community members might have about your idea.

d. To further spread the word, you can share the link to your Idea with the community via Polkassembly and Element Polkadot/Kusama channels.

This year we plan to further integrate with Polkassembly to automatically share the Ideas and discussions, so stay tuned!

### 2\. Publish the Proposal

This step is when things get serious. You got the feedback, applied some changes and you are ready to turn your idea into a formal Treasury proposal. Maybe you want to start small, with just one milestone and then go with the next one? You can do that as well using the application.

a. Choose your idea or idea's milestone and click "Turn into proposal". To perform this operation you will need a blockchain account to sign the transaction and place the required deposit.

b. Now  it's time to  keep your fingers crossed and check on your proposal's status. You might need to answer some more questions in the Discussions tab, so make sure you check your in-app notifications or that you switched on the email notifications as well.

c. You will also be informed whenever a new motion concerning your proposal is opened. Everyone will be able to follow the results of the motions in the details of your proposal.

### 3\. The approval (or rejection)

This is  when you celebrate (or learn that you'll have to work on your proposal a bit more). When the motions reach a conclusion, your proposal is either accepted or rejected.

### ... And if you want to browse and discuss other people's ideas

You'd like to take a look first, to see what others are up to? You can browse the active ideas for each network as well as current proposals without the need to log in.

However, if you'd like to engage in a discussion or work on your own idea, you'll need to create an account. It's a very quick process, especially if you already have a Web3 blockchain account, which you can use to sign up. When you are logged in, you get access to discussions and possibility to present your ideas for proposals.
